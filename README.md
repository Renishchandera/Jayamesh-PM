## ✨ Why Jayamesh Commander?

### 🎯 **Built for Real Project Management**

### 🔒 **Privacy-First & Offline**

```

## 💡 Core Philosophy

Most project management tools are either:
- ❌ **Too simple** (basic todo lists)
- ❌ **Too complex** (enterprise bloatware)  
- ❌ **Too expensive** (monthly subscriptions)
- ❌ **Privacy concerns** (cloud-only storage)

**Jayamesh Commander** strikes the perfect balance: powerful enough for serious project management, simple enough to start using immediately, and private enough that your data never leaves your machine.

## 🎯 What Makes It Different

| **Customization** | Limited | Your rules |
